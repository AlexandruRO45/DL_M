<ul><li> You developed a fully convolutional model (FCN) which is excellent. [score = 1 / 1] </li>
<li> You correctly split the dataset into a training dataset and a validation dataset for hyperparameter tuning - which is excellent. [score = 1 / 1] </li>
<li> You did hyperparameter tuning which is excellent. [score = 1 / 1] </li>
<li> You correctly showed loss/accuracy curves which is good. [score = 1 / 1] </li>
<li> You did captum interpretation analysis where you discovered something about your model - excellent ! [score = 1 / 1] </li>
<li> You had generally good code comments and markup including discussion sections of Notebook markup. [score = 2 / 2] </li>
</ul><h2 style='color:navy;'> Notebook Score: 7 / 7 </h2>
